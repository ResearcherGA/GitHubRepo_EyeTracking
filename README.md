 Datasets of Eye movements

The original but uncleaned, collected datasets are in convenient csv format for doing more interactive analysis

(meta data describing simply about the experimental collected data of eye tracking)
The parameters of eye movement data intended such as,
1. the tracking time in millisecond (Time[msec]),
2. ticking time during eye movements (Time[Ticks]),
3. gaze X and Y coordinates (GazeX, GazeY),
4. the diameter of eye movement focused circle (Diameter),
5. the left and right calibrations of the eye tracking device in terms of left and right eyes
6. Left and Right calibrations (LCalib, RCalib)
7. the left and right cross sectional positions in terms of left and right eyes (LFound, RFound)
8. the left eye’s X coordinate, Y coordinate, and diameter of focused circle (LX, LY, LD)
9. the right eye’s X coordinate, Y coordinate, and diameter of focused circle (RX, RY, RD)
10. the positional accuracy of eye gaze in terms of logical; FALSE or TRUE (Lost)
